# Machine Learning Web App - Logistic Regression


Welcome to my Machine Learning Web App project! This project is built using logistic regression and the `sklearn` library for training and data splitting. The trained model is then deployed as a web application using the "Streamlit" library and hosted on Heroku.

## Introduction
In this project, I developed a simple yet effective machine learning model using logistic regression. The model is trained on a dataset and used to predict outcomes based on the input data. The web application built using Streamlit allows users to interact with the model and see its predictions in real-time.

## Features
- Train a logistic regression model
- Interact with the model through a user-friendly web interface
- Real-time predictions on user input
- Easy-to-use and intuitive UI

## Technologies
- Python
- scikit-learn (sklearn)
- Streamlit
- Heroku

## Setup
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repo`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
To run the web application locally, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to access the application.

## Deployment
The web app is deployed on Heroku and can be accessed at [your-app-url.com](https://your-app-url.com).
